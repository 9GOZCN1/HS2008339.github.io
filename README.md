<b>Objective of TRACK AND FIELD<b>
  - Track and field involves running on a track over a specified distances and in the case of the hurdlingand steeplechase events, obstacles may be placed on the track. There are also relay races in which teams of athletes run and pass on a batonto their team member at the end of a certain distance.
 
 <b>Hurdle and Sprint Rules<b>
 - Start: Starting blocks are used for all hurdle, relay and sprint events. The starting blocks consist of two adjustable footplates attached to a rigid frame. Olympic hurdle and sprint races commence with the firing of the Starter's gun. The starting commands are "On your marks" and "Set." Once all athletes are in the set position, the Starter's gun is fired, officially starting the race. For the 100m, women's 100m hurdles and men's 110m hurdles, all competitors are lined up side-by-side. For the 200m, 400m and 400m hurdles, which involve curves, runners are staggered for the start.
 
 - False Starts: If a sprinter commences his or her starting motion from the set position before the Starter's gun is fired, it is deemed a false start. The first false start of a race results in an automatic disqualification to the offending runner.
 
 - Lanes: For all Olympic sprint and hurdle events, runners must remain within their pre-assigned lanes, which measure 1.22 meters (4 feet) wide, from start to finish. The lanes are numbered 1 through 8, starting with the inside lane. Any athlete who runs outside the assigned lane is subject to disqualification. If the athlete is forced to run outside of his or her lane by another person, and no material advantage is gained, there will be no disqualification. Also, a runner who strays from his or her lane in the straightaway, or crosses the outer line of his or her lane on the bend, and gains no advantage by it, will not be disqualified as long as no other runner is obstructed.
 
 - The finish: The first athlete whose torso (as distinguished from the head, neck, arms, legs, hands or feet) reaches the vertical plane of the closest edge of the finish line is the winner.
 
 - Negotiating hurdles: Any competitor who trails a foot or leg below the horizontal plane of the top of any hurdle at the instant of clearance will be disqualified.
 
 <b>Middle Distance Rules<b>
 
 - Start: With all individual races 800m and longer, there are no starting blocks; runners begin in an upright position, their hands prohibited from touching the ground. The starting command for these races is "On your marks." Once all athletes are at the mark, the Starter's gun is fired, officially starting the race. An 800m race comprises eight runners, each in his or her own lane for the staggered start; in the 1500m and steeplechase, which have up to 12 runners, a group start is used. 
 
 - Lanes: In the 800m, all runners must stay within their assigned lanes through the first turn, after which they break for position to the inside lane. In the 1500m and steeplechase, there are no lane assignments and runners jockey for position from the start.
 
 - Lanes: Negotiating barriers: In the steeplechase, any competitor who steps to the side of a jump or trails his foot or leg along side any barrier will be disqualified. Athletes may go over the barriers in any way, as long as no part of the foot or leg falls below the horizontal plane of the top bar at the instance of clearance.
 
 <b>Distance Rules<b>
 
 - Start: In Olympic distance events, there are no starting blocks; runners begin in an upright position, their hands prohibited from touching the ground. The starting command for these races is "On your marks." Once all athletes are at the mark, the Starter's gun is fired, officially starting the race. Distance races begin with mass starts. When there are more than 12 competitors in a race, they can be split into two staggered groups for the start: one with roughly 65 percent of the runners on the regular start line, another with the other runners on a separate start line across the track's outer half. The latter group runs on the outer half until clearing the first bend.
